Skills Matcher Inception
=====================================

## Original Project Idea from Milestone_1

    -- Resume Experience Skill Extraction and Correlation -- 

    Need: A person may be losing their current employment position, or wish to 
    discover a new position that requires a similar skill set. It is sometimes 
    difficult to find these positions, as the average person doesn’t have very 
    much experience with the duties, tasks, and responsibilities of other jobs 
    in different industries and may not know what they would qualify for. 

    How: By extracting their employment experience commonly found in a person's 
    resume, we could break down their previous experience into individual skills 
    corresponding to the NAICS classification of Industry, the US Standard 
    Occupational Classification, and currently available Accredited College 
    Majors. This would give the user the ability to match aspects they liked or 
    were good at from their previous employment with positions in other 
    industries that are similar in their duties, tasks, responsibilities, 
    and skill sets required. 

## What is new/original about this idea? 
    Breaking down previous experience into individual skills and tasks. 

    Matching personal skills with national classification standards and accredited institutions for degrees and certifications.

    Assists the user with creating a roadmap to acheive desired occupation titles from their current skill set.

## What are related websites/apps? 
(Be able to answer the question: isn’t somebody already doing this?)

    Indeed and Glass Door have a good search engine.


## Why is this idea worth doing? Why is it useful and not boring?
    It's worth doing because everyone could benifit from a roadmap to skill acquistion to acheive their desired goals.

## What are a few major features?
    Extracting information from a users resumes in a few formats 

    Creating a list of occupational titles that most closely relate the users current skill base.

    The User can select a desired occupation title and generate a roadmap to aquire any additional skills into their skill base required for said occupation.

    The User can input their location, and options for degrees and certifications missing from their roadmap would be generated

## What resources will be required for you to complete this project that are not already included in the class. i.e. you already have the Microsoft stack, server, database so what else would you need? Additional API’s, frameworks or platforms you’ll need to use.
    Bureau of labor statistics API

    Indeeds API

    CollegeAI API

    The process of extracting data from word or pdf files to match.

## What algorithmic content is there in this project? i.e. what algorithm(s) will you have to develop or implement in order to do something central to your project idea? (Remember, this isn’t just a software engineering course, it is your CS degree capstone course!)
    The main algorithm will need to break occupations down into skills, consider those skills either acheived or needed, and link to local options for acheivement. 

## Rate the topic with a difficulty rating of 1-10. One being supremely easy to implement (not necessarily short though). Ten would require the best CS students using lots of what they learned in their CS degree, plus additional independent learning, to complete successfully.
