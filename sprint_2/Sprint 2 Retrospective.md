Sprint 2
===========================

# Sprint 1 Project retrospective
## Things that went well 
- Baltazar: Our website looks pretty good, and it doing mostly what we want. 
- Derek: We had pretty good vertical slices for our work, THree.js was easier to impliment into the asp.net core project then I thought it would be.
- Rafael: When needed we showed that we can work together to solve issues. 
- Cuauhtemoc: Things mostly worked. 

## Things that did not go well
- Baltazar: The lake of time that we had, because people had other classes, and those other classes have a lot of homework. We had some last min bugs. 
- Derek: We had some last min bugs that we were able to fix in time for the live demo. 
- Rafael: did not give enough of a time buffer for us to do testing. 
- Cuauhtemoc: We should have done somethig on monday to get the project working.

## Learn from the Sprint: 
- Baltazar: We could do some quick error checking the day before the sprint review so that we can catch what is going on, and have some more time to work on it. 
- Derek: I should spend more time looking and asking about other peoples code so I have a better understanding of whats going on in the project as a whole. 
- Rafael: Need to complete use stories with more time to ingegrate and complete with others. 
- Cuauhtemoc: We should work more on putting it together as the project is getting more complex. 

## What can the team do better next sprint: 
- Baltazar: We could write better user stories, we can focus also on the acceptance criteria. 
- Derek: I should ask more questions and be more involved in other group members user stories. 
- Rafael: Ask for input from other team members and ask other team members about what is going on with their user stories.
- Cuauhtemoc: We should work more on putting it together as the project is getting more complex. 

## Our Action Plan: 
Communicate more and ask more questions if there is anything we are unsure about. Also sharing the code we are writing with eachother when we have questions.
