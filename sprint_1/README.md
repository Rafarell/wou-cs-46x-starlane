Sprint 1
===========================

# Sprint 1 Project retrospective
## Things that went well 
- Baltazar: Getting familiar with pivotal tracker was nearly seamless. People were available on Discord for the most part when asking for help.
- Derek: Pivotal tracker was nice to use, and the identity+ framework was easy enough to follow even though being very time consuming.
- Rafael: Despite unforseen setbacks, teammates went beyond the scope of their duty to make sure sprint 1 was successful.
- Cuauhtemoc: The actual user story was easy enough to implement and gave me ideas for other things to make.

## Things that did not go well
- Baltazar: The weather but also not knowing all requirements for the sprint up front. For example, the rubric was not up until the middle of the current sprint, during midterm season...
- Derek: THe weather. Not planing sprint one enough as a team lead to me adding a lot of work that was needed by everyone, and with no other volunteers I did the majority of the extra work myself by adding it my 2 point user story. For the good of the project / team, if I was to estimate the points now, I would say that I had an 8 and a 6 lol.
- Rafael: Power outage, being stagnate for too long, and not enough communication with teammates.
- Cuauhtemoc: Timing; I also spent a while reading through the code to catch up.

## Learn from the Sprint: 
- Baltazar: I learned how to better use LINQ to query databases and better use git for getting commits onto my local computer. 
- Derek: I overestimate my ability, and under estimated the difficulty of the work itself.
- Rafael: I should always be working to stay involved and practice what I already know in order to be an asset and not have setbacks.
- Cuauhtemoc: I should make sure I know what everyone else is doing so I don't break anything.

## What can the team do better next sprint: 
- Baltazar: Being proactive and getting started on sprints ASAP. To be far, getting identity up and running was a blocker. Even then my advice would be, "Work on what is not impeded by blockers. i.e. UI, testing, etc."
- Derek: We can all have more of an opinion when we are deciding upon the work for the next sprint. 
- Rafael: Be more vocal and work closer as a team.
- Cuauhtemoc: We should definitely work towards pushing the project in one direction.

## Our Action Plan: 

The day after the new user stories are added to the sprint backlog and assigned, each member rewrites their assigned user stories in their own words and shows them to the group during the next meeting.
