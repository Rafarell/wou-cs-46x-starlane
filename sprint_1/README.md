Sprint 1
===========================

# Sprint 1 Project retrospective
## Things that went well 
- Baltazar: 
- Derek: Pivotal tracker was nice to use, and the identity+ framework was easy enough to follow even though being very time consuming.
- Rafael:
- Cuauhtemoc:

## Things that did not go well
- Baltazar:
- Derek: THe weather. Not planing sprint one enough as a team lead to me adding a lot of work that was needed by everyone, and with no other volunteers I did the majority of the extra work myself by adding it my 2 point user story. For the good of the project / team, if I was to estimate the points now, I would say that I had an 8 and a 6 lol.

## Learn from the Sprint: 
- Baltazar:
- Derek: I overestimate my ability, and under estimated the difficulty of the work itself.
- Rafael: 
- Cuauhtemoc: 

## What can the team do better next sprint: 
- Baltazar: 
- Derek: We can all have more of an opinion when we are deciding upon the work for the next sprint.

- Cuauhtemoc: 

## Our Action Plan:
