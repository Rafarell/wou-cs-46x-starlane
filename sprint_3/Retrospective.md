Sprint 3
===========================

# Sprint 3 Project retrospective
## Things that went well 
- Baltazar: Getting the testing suites up and running went well. We did a great job of writing our user stories. They were well written and covered acceptance criteria. We did a good job of adhering to the Open-Closed Principle by adding more code to the DatabaseHelper class without changing the previous code already in it.
- Derek: Having the extra week of spring worked well, as I was able to make a new environment during that time. Unit testing is helping me work on the project better and develop better code for difficult conversions.
- Rafael: Improved communication and collaboration, I was able to find teammates well and promptly whenever I had doubts and needed extra help throughout the sprint. Features were implemented using clean easy to read code.
- Cuauhtemoc: Getting testing working went smoother than expected. Features were implemented cleanly. 

## Things that did not go well
- Baltazar: I noticed everybody was busier than usual outside of class. Some people had to go to the doctor. I had some family over from out of town for the whole sprint and had to do some favors/chores for other family so I missed some meetings. Which gave me less time and energy to work on things.
- Derek: I didn't realize that everyone isnt able to make their own databases for development and have been relying on the live demo dbs I made for sprint one. As the project gets more complex and we are creating more objects in the database, its important to be able to work with the database ourselves, and make the changes we need without having to rely on another person to make those changes for us. I also gave myself a user story that was more like a 16 than a 4, and had too many issues pop up that made it so I couldnt complete the user story. More realistic work standards should be used for the rest of the term. 
- Rafael: Did not start working with enough urgency. Database uncertainties and inaccessibility, not taking the time to examine database and understand its design/structure thoroughly and how it's being utilized became detrimental.
- Cuauhtemoc: Lots of business outside of class. Creating unit tests for most functions is difficult because of how tightly the app is coupled to the database.

## Learn from the Sprint: 
- Baltazar: I learned to use nunit and how to return photos from an api endpoint. I learned how to write better user stories.
- Derek: Post-redirect-get with persistent data, using form model binding with multiple pages of forms, and the unit testing jest framework.
- Rafael: I learned about nunit testing and more about extracting data from the database using linq queries, particularly about how to work with more of the data types the queries return. 
- Cuauhtemoc: I learned more about asynchronous functionality between the controller and AJAX.

## What can the team do better next sprint: 
- Baltazar: We could start on sprints right away so that if we encounter any difficulties, we get them resolved ahead of time rather than right before the sprint deadline.
- Derek: Do better sprint planning, have our own db's to develop with.
- Rafael: Integrate/Collaborate sooner.
- Cuauhtemoc: We could start sooner.

## Our Action Plan: 
- Baltazar: If you do not have another class this term, start the sprint ASAP.
- Cuauhtemoc: Learn more about unit testing and refactoring to deal with the database problem.
- Rafael: Start working with more urgency and start sooner, share work with others and ask questions as soon as possible if necessary.
- Derek: Don't assign myself so much work.
