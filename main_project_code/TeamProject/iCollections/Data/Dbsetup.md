# How to reset models and database on Azure from scratch (assuming VSCode)

*May be missing some steps*

### Before you do this, try running the scripts that Scot gives if you have a windows machine

## Background:

Copy the following into a separate folder in case you mess something up:
+ All the models made by scaffolding
+ appsettings.json
+ old dbcontexts

## Step 1:

+ Make Azure servers and databases (CS 460)

## Step 2:

*Start here if you have first if you just need to reset databases*

+ Get connection string from Azure (write everything down)
+ Use VSCode mssql extension to run down (if needed), up, and seed sql scripts

*May need to restart connection to get this to work*

## Step 3:

+ Put connection string in appsettings.json in "ConnectionStrings" {}
+ Take out password field from string ie "Password={}"
+ Run:  \
    `dotnet user-secrets set "ICollections:ServerPassword" "{password}"`
+ Add these lines to ConfigureServices() in Startup.cs (assuming your connection strings have that name and both use the same password) \
    `var authBuilder = new SqlConnectionStringBuilder(Configuration.GetConnectionString("AuthenticationConnection"));`
            `var appBuilder = new SqlConnectionStringBuilder(Configuration.GetConnectionString("ICollectionsConnection"));`
            `authBuilder.Password = Configuration["ICollections:ServerPassword"];`
            `appBuilder.Password = Configuration["ICollections:ServerPassword"];`

## Step 4:

+ Do migration stuff
+ Run: \
    `dotnet ef database update --context ApplicationDbContext`
+ Scaffold database tables (FROM APP DB ONLY!!!)
+ RUN: \
    `dotnet ef dbcontext scaffold "{Put your connection string to app db here}" Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer --context ICollectionsDbContext --context-dir Data --output-dir Models --verbose --force`
+ Change the optionsBuilder.UseSqlServer() to have reference to connection string rather than your actual string for security reasons
+ Error when I run this (which I guess I have to do???)
+ RUN: \
    `dotnet aspnet-codegenerator controller -name ICollectionsUsersController -m IcollectionUser -dc ICollectionsDbContext --relativeFolderPath Controllers --useDefaultLayout --referenceScriptLibraries --force`

## Step 5:

*If you have not made a auth db on Azure yet, do it now*

+ Make a up script automatically
+ Run: \
    `dotnet ef migrations script --context ApplicationDbContext --output Data/DataUpdateIdentityAzure.sql`
+ Run up script for auth db generated by above command using mssql extension

## Step 6:

+ Seed accounts (Hareem, Talia, etc) by simply running the web app locally
+ Run: \
    `dotnet run`

## Step 7:

+ Set up secret for seeded user's password `dotnet user-secrets set "SeedUserPW" <pw>` OR set it up in Azure Key Vault via Portal (Warning: Costs money probably)
+ If you want deploy your app but I don't see why since we just want to reset database stuff
