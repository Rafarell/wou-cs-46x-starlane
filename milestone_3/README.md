# Team Project Inception: Vision statement (10pts)

**For** anyone **who** wants a easy and fun way to share with others their collections or collectables, **the** 360 iCollectables Creator **can** upload and render photos of their collectable items **that** will be displayed in 2D, 360 degree, or possibly 360 full virtual environment. The system will store the users uploaded photos of items, allow user selection of the available environments, and give the ability to place their items into the environment at specific locations, and then allow others to view their environments filled with their collectable items. **Unlike** albums of photos **our users** will be able to show off large collections of items in a single format that can easily show the scale of the collection, while maintaining the ability to inspect individual items closely.
