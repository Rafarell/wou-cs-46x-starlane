# Class Project retrospective (10pts)
    link or copy here for the following stuff:
1. Fun Retrospectives 
    - need to do and document as a team.
2. What did we learn from the sprint 
    - everyones responce 
3. What isn't going well?
    - everyones responce 
4. What can the team do better during the next Sprint? We need a specific Action Plan. 
    - need to make an action plan for the next sprint as a team to fix any issues we had from the previous sprint.

# Team project inception concluded
    link or copy here for the following stuff:
1. Complete the inception document 
2. all other files are updates.
3. all older versions from the previous milestones are removed so we only have one of each document. 


# Main Read me on Github
    Headers that should be included, although not filled out. aka have a section for license, but leave it blank for now. Fill out everything possible with the following list of topics 
    

1. Why are you doing this project? Please reference the senior capstone courses at WOU.
2. Guidelines and Contributing code to the project. How to contribute. What rules to follow when writing code? Database? Should you always make the primary key just ID or use the style of ProductID? What about id's in HTML elements? Class names? Model naming convention? Leading underscore's for private member variables? Here's a short example I wrote for a class a while ago that will give you some ideas: Guidelines
3. Clearly list all team members. Link to their personal GitHub pages. This will be a great project for potential employers to look at, so make it obvious you worked on it!
4. What software construction processes or lifecycles are you using? Links to important documents?
5. Any team rules?
6. List of tools used, including versions where relevant. Continuous development/deployment? Link to your deployed site?

1. Project name: Your project’s name is the first thing people will see upon scrolling down to your README, and is included upon creation of your README file.
2. Description: A description of your project follows. A good description is clear, short, and to the point. Describe the importance of your project, and what it does.
3. Table of Contents: Optionally, include a table of contents in order to allow other people to quickly navigate especially long or detailed READMEs.
4. Installation: Installation is the next section in an effective README. Tell other users how to install your project locally. Optionally, include a gif to make the process even more clear for other people.
5. Usage: The next section is usage, in which you instruct other people on how to use your project after they’ve installed it. This would also be a good place to include screenshots of your project in action.
6. Contributing: Larger projects often have sections on contributing to their project, in which contribution instructions are outlined. Sometimes, this is a separate file. If you have specific contribution preferences, explain them so that other developers know how to best contribute to your work. To learn more about how to help others contribute, check out the guide for setting guidelines for repository contributors.
7. Credits: Include a section for credits in order to highlight and link to the authors of your project.
8. License: Finally, include a section for the license of your project. For more information on choosing a license, check out GitHub’s licensing guide!


# Team pRoject COnstruction preparation 

1. All epics for all core features are entered and in priority order
2. All user stories that you've written to this point are entered and prioritized
3. You've estimated the effort points (as a team) for enough of the highest priority stories to make one whole sprint plus a few extra. This will help you choose ones that add up to our starting velocity.
4. The stories that might go into Sprint 1 are very well defined and have tasks (i.e. you've followed the exemplar). Tasks are written to itemize the steps needed to implement and test (manually) the story. If you find that you don't yet know some of the "what" (to build) for stories in Sprint 1 then you should work on it some more. If you find that you don't yet know some of the "how" (to build it) for stories that's totally normal at this point -- there will be a lot of learning going on every Sprint. We'll try to take care of those unknowns by recognizing them when estimating stories.
5. You should select one team member to act as the Scrum Master to keep your meeting on task and progressing efficiently. We haven't practiced Scrum Master skills yet so you'll have to wing it for now based on what you saw in the Scrum training series videos.
6. Select and commit user stories for Sprint 1. This is a two week, 100% capacity Sprint, so you have quite a bit of time. Be sure to have the first few user stories be ones that prove your architecture and get everything running smoothly before trying to add significant functionality. Handle dependencies the best way you can; enter blockers in Pivotal Tracker. If your project will have individual user accounts then now is the time to set it up. There are videos and materials to help you out in Canvas. You need to have enough stories in the Sprint so that each team member has 6 effort points per sprint. That's 6 * 4 = 24 effort points total if you have 4 team members or 6 * 3 = 18 if you have 3 team members. Use the definition of effort points that we've gone over in Canvas.
7. Ideally you want each team member to select their own stories on a just-in-time basis, limiting WIP (work in progress) to one story per person at a time. For this first sprint, however, go around and choose the entire sprint's worth of stories for each person. But you only work on one user story at a time!
8. Be ready for the start of the sprint after your review meeting next week. Plan to have 4 points worth of stories done per developer within the first week, and earlier if there are dependencies with a teammate's story. Do not under any circumstances think that you have 2 weeks to do this work and then wait until late in week 2 to start or do all your work. Imagine if you were a professional developer and did that in your job. What would happen? If you are sick or otherwise unable to work on your project, immediately alert your teammates and then your project advisor. Teammates should do what they can to continue with the project. We will deal with events like this on a case-by-case basis.
9. At the end of the sprint you'll demo all work at the Sprint Review Meeting and stories will be accepted or rejected based upon their descriptions in Pivotal Tracker.
