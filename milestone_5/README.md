# Class Project retrospective (10pts)
## Things that went well 
- Baltazar: Our git workflow is very good. We have not had any bugs reach production. If we make a mistake, its easy to revert the code and solve it. The maintainer is doing a good job of merging pull requests.
- Derek: We were able to figure out different parts of the project to work on, and our git workflow has not had any issues.
- Rafael: We were able to assign responsibilities within our team without friction and everyone knows the direction were headed on a large scale, so we were able to get our work done and move quickly.
- Cuauhtemoc: Good delegation of tasks, and so far things have been very manageable.

## Things that did not go well
- Baltazar: Misunderstood requirements. In the class project, I thought the person working on the search filters was going to put the features and functionality in the expeditions and peaks pages, not the home page. We also need to improve meetings. I think it would be a huge mistake to rush the meetings. I understand trying to go fast. I understand everyone has other classes and are doing other homework. However, currently we really just cover just the rubric requirements and assign rubric requirements per person. I think we should slow down just a little bit during meetings. We have like 4 outside of class during the week.
- Derek: We as a team need to do a better job at communicating with each other so that we all know exactly what each of us should be working on and how our work will affect the other team members.
- Rafael: On a smaller or more detailed level, I feel like we all need to be more active in communicating with each other in terms of what or how we can use each other on to complete each task more efficiently as a team.
- Cuauhtemoc: As the project becomes more complex, I wonder how the time needed for individual tasks will increase.

## Learn from the Sprint: 
- Baltazar: I learned how to put user stories into exemplar format and assign effort points.
- Derek: Working with js and ajax again was a good refresher for preparing to work with three.js in the asp.net core mvc framework. I also learned that I need to do a better job at communicating with my team about the work that Iâ€™m doing for the group project so everyone can have a better understanding of the design and purpose.
- Rafael: I learned about the complexities of working with a team and how many issues can arise if communication is not optimal. I also learned how to resolve,merge conflicts and why it is important to keep features independent from each other.
- Cuauhtemoc: Getting the hang of managing the git workflow when people are actually making changes at the same time.

## What can the team do better next sprint: 
- Baltazar: We can have a rough schedule of what meetings will take place and when. We can also collaborate on any confusion when discussing implementing user stories. We can also slow down during the meetings.
- Derek: Obviously communication is the biggest thing we could focus on to improve. We could take steps for an action plan that include announcing when we start our work on discord and the tasks that we are doing. We could have a rough plan of meeting topics so that we all make the best use of our group meetings.
- Rafael: We each make more of an effort to be more vocal, as it seems we all want more and more efficient communication, as well as have a more detailed plan of goals that we want to accomplish for a specific meeting or sprint per se.
- Cuauhtemoc: Focus on having a clear direction to go in.

## Our Action Plan: 
    In order to increase communication and coordination we as a team are going to talk more about the 
    work we are currently doing in discord and have rough agendas planned for our meetings, so that we
     can slow down the meetings themselves and have the opportunity to discuss the finer details more 
     thoroughly.
