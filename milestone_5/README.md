# Class Project retrospective (10pts)
## Things that went well 
- Baltazar: Our git workflow is very good. We have not had any bugs reach production. If we make a mistake, its easy to revert the code and solve it. The maintainer is doing a good job of merging pull requests.
- Derek: We were able to figure out different parts of the project to work on, and our git workflow has not had any issues.
- Rafael: 
- Cuauhtemoc: 

## Things that did not go well
- Baltazar: Misunderstood requirements. In the class project, I thought the person working on the search filters was going to put the features and functionality in the expeditions and peaks pages, not the home page. We also need to improve meetings. I think it would be a huge mistake to rush the meetings. I understand trying to go fast. I understand everyone has other classes and are doing other homework. However, currently we really just cover just the rubric requirements and assign rubric requirements per person. I think we should slow down just a little bit during meetings. We have like 4 outside of class during the week.
- Derek: We as a team need to do a better job at communicating with each other so that we all know exactly what each of us should be working on and how our work will affect the other team members.
- Rafael: 
- Cuauhtemoc: 

## Learn from the Sprint: 
- Baltazar: I learned how to put user stories into exemplar format and assign effort points.
- Derek: Working with js and ajax again was a good refresher for preparing to work with three.js in the asp.net core mvc framework. I also learned that I need to do a better job at communicating with my team about the work that Iâ€™m doing for the group project so everyone can have a better understanding of the design and purpose.
- Rafael: 
- Cuauhtemoc: 

## What can the team do better next sprint: 
- Baltazar: We can have a rough schedule of what meetings will take place and when. We can also collaborate on any confusion when discussing implementing user stories. We can also slow down during the meetings.
- Derek: Obviously communication is the biggest thing we could focus on to improve. We could take steps for an action plan that include announcing when we start our work on discord and the tasks that we are doing. We could have a rough plan of meeting topics so that we all make the best use of our group meetings.
- Rafael: 
- Cuauhtemoc: 

## Our Action Plan: 
    In order to increase communication and coordination we as a team are going to talk more about the work we are currently doing in discord and have rough agendas planned for our meetings, so that we can slow down the meetings themselves and have the opportunity to discuss the finer details more thoroughly.
